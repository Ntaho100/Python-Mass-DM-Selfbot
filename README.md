# Python-Mass-DM-Selfbot
Thanks for looking at my bot! 

Dependencies:
- Discum (`pip install discum`)
- Rich (`pip install rich`)

This doesn't require the user that is going to be DMed to make any interaction. It scrapes all the user IDs in a server then DMs them.

How to run:
- Git Clone (Download as zip and extract, or run `git clone https://github.com/Apophis52/Python-Mass-DM-Selfbot.git .`)
- Run the python file (double click or `python3.9 index.py`)
- Fill out the questions. (Just type in the content.)
- Recommended delay of 25

# STUPID ISSUESS WILL BE CLOSED.
